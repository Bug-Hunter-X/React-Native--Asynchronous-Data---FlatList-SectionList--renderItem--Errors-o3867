# React Native: Asynchronous Data and FlatList/SectionList `renderItem` Issues

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native when using FlatList or SectionList components with asynchronous data fetching.  The `renderItem` function attempts to access data before it's fully loaded, resulting in errors or unexpected behavior.

## Problem
The `renderItem` function within a FlatList or SectionList often relies on data fetched asynchronously (e.g., from an API). If the `renderItem` is called before the data has been fully loaded and the state is updated, the attempt to access `item.name` (or similar properties) results in an error because `item` might be undefined.

## Solution
The solution involves conditional rendering or handling the initial loading state to prevent the `renderItem` function from executing before the data is available.  This could involve using a loading indicator, an empty list view, or a conditional check before rendering each item.
